## Questions? 🤔

### Common Questions Answered

**Q: Can I change the plan?**
A: Yes! This is a living roadmap. Adjust priorities based on business needs.

**Q: Do I need to do all of Phase 2 before Phase 3?**
A: Phase 2 is recommended first. You need content and CRM before e-commerce. But some tasks can be reordered within phases.

**Q: How much of this can ChatGPT do?**
A: ChatGPT is excellent for copy, content, templates, and strategy. It cannot write code, configure systems, or do visual design. Use it for all writing tasks.

**Q: What if I want to launch e-commerce sooner?**
A: Possible, but risky. You'll have an online store with no content, no lead nurturing, and no product storytelling. Better to build the foundation first.

**Q: Is the budget negotiable?**
A: Yes. Estimates assume professional rates. You can reduce costs by:
- Using freelancers instead of agencies
- Doing content writing in-house
- Using free tools instead of paid
- Phasing work more gradually

**Q: What if I get stuck?**
A: Refer to PROGRESS_TRACKER.md blocker section. Document the blocker, identify who can resolve it, and escalate if needed.

## Final Recommendation 🎯

**Your foundation is solid.** The age gate is enterprise-grade, the design is professional, and the technical infrastructure is sound.

**Focus your energy on Phase 2.** Get the inquiry form working, tell the Tarik Areke story, and start building your email list. These are high-impact, achievable goals for the next 6-8 weeks.

**Don't rush to e-commerce.** You need leads and brand awareness first. A beautiful online store with no visitors or trust signals won't generate sales.

**Use this roadmap as your north star.** Update it weekly, track progress daily, and celebrate small wins. You're building something professional and scalable.

**You're in great shape to succeed.** 🥃
